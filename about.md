Hello, my name is Quy who love solving business problems using data and mathematics models.

### More Information
I am a data science manager, who have been working in the last 10 years in the data analytic space. With information system engineer background, I lead several successful data project teams. I became interested in data science management and have gone back to school to earn a business management degree. 

As an individual contributor, I ship complex analytics projects using quantitative analysis and machine learning in marketing, retail, e-commerce. I develop best practices for the entire data science lifecycle, including business problem formulation, data management, modeling, and MLOPs (pipeline, validation, monitoring performance, data change, etc).

As a leader, I have 2+ years of experience in building and managing teams of 3-5 data scientists. I establish common goals, direction, and accountability among employees. I also contribute to the development of the next generation of data scientists by mentoring interns from local schools.

As a lifelong learner, I was very into learning through modelling competitions. My proudest achievements include the Kaggle Master and a paper published at the Advanced Data Mining and Application Conference (ADMA) for the winning prize at the Safety for the elderly. Nowadays, I aspire to learn new areas such as leadership and analytics in different business domains especially in healthcare, supply chain and agriculture.

If there are opportunies, here is [my resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_F5naZxv_xAi4Cw1Yk0ENqM8OZFzf3SjNypb1SCQe4/edit?usp=sharing). We could to discuss more.
