Hello there, I'm Quy, a data science manager with a passion for leveraging data and mathematical models to solve complex business problems.

### [My journey](https://drivendata.co/blog/community-spotlight-quy-nguyen)
With 10+ years of experience in data analytics, I specialize in quantitative analysis, machine learning, and data management for industries ranging from games, news, banking, retail, to e-commerce.

My expertise in the data science lifecycle extends from business problem formulation to modeling and MLOps (pipeline, validation, monitoring performance, data change, etc.), allowing me to deliver successful analytics projects. Additionally, I have 2+ years of experience in building and managing teams of 3-5 data scientists, establishing common goals and accountability to drive team success.

I hold a degree in Information System Engineering and Business Management. As a lifelong learner, I actively seek new opportunities to broaden my skill set and knowledge, including participating in modeling competitions such as Kaggle. I am particularly interested in healthcare, supply chain, and agriculture analytics.

I am proud to have been awarded [Kaggle Master](https://www.kaggle.com/quyntk) and have had a [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69179-4_58) published at the Advanced Data Mining and Application Conference (ADMA) for [winning the Safety for the Elderly prize](https://drivendata.co/blog/sphere-winners/). If you're interested in discussing potential opportunities or learning more about my experience, please feel free to check out my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_F5naZxv_xAi4Cw1Yk0ENqM8OZFzf3SjNypb1SCQe4/edit?usp=sharing) and reach out to me.
