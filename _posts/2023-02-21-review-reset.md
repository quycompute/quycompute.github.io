# 2022
After numerous attempts at creating a proper blog and improving my writing, I'm giving it another shot this year. I realized my failure was due to a lack of SMART goals (no target for how many blogs I would write) or because my dreams were too big (i.e publishing every week). This time, I intend to publish 12 posts in 2023. The first blog is a review of my 2022 goals that I wrote at the end of the year. I wrote on Notion. Now I'm putting it here to kick off my new blog.

## Review

### Highlights of the year 

1. I got married, to the Moomin family.
2. Moomin family treated our parents to a 10 days trip to Viet Nam.
3. Birthday and honeymoon in Bali.

### Lessons of the year

1. Respect personal space (especially my husband).
2. I attended Courageous conversation and data storytelling - 3 is the magic number.

### Growth
