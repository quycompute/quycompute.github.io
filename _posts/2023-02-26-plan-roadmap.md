title: 2023 Writing Plan

# No. 2

One of my **specific** personal goals this year is to write N posts (**measurable**) on this space, as I mentioned in [my 2022 review and 2023 reset](https://quycompute.github.io/review-reset/). And the purpose of this post is to explain why and to lay out a **achievable** plan for it. In this post, I want to use the planning skill, one of key skills in my data science manager role to deliver a carefully roadmap for this blog. And I hope it is also **relevant** to the community.

## Step 1: Identify the problem that needs to be solved. 
I am well aware that maintaining a personal blog can be a valuable tool for any professional looking to develop and improve their skills, communicate their ideas, and expand their network. I can improve my leadership, technical, and communication skills and become more effective by devoting time and effort to writing. 

On a professional level, the first step in planning a roadmap is identifying the business problem that must be addressed. Engaging with stakeholders and understanding their pain points, as well as assessing the data available to determine what insights can be gleaned, are all part of this process. After identifying the problem, I must collaborate with the team to define the objectives and outcomes that must be met to solve it. At the moment, my blog is only for me. I want to write for myself first, and then hopefully inspire others to do the same.

## Step 2: Determine the resource and communication
At work, I frequently identify each member of my team's skills, expertise, and preferences, as well as any additional tools or technologies that may be required. I try to align company goals with the goals of each team member (for example, the topic of interest). Finally, prioritize these resources in order of importance to achieve the desired results.

Considering team members' personal goals allows me to communicate the company goals to the team, particularly the rationale behind each task and how their individual contributions fit into the larger picture. I strive for win-win situations in which my team members learn something while working on a project they enjoy, and the projects are successful. To answer the WHY question, one of the skills I want to improve for my blog is writing. Other than writing, I have other plans (i.e coding, online learning, reading, and traveling). As a result, the monthly publication is a more attainable and realistic goal for me.

## Step 3: Setup roadmap and check-in
At the moment, I am planning 12 post ideas and creating an editorial calendar as shown below.

A few words about this road map:
1. I designated a release week to ensure that my goal is met on time (**time-bound**). At work, it's critical for me - the manager - to regularly check in with the team to ensure they're on track and to make any necessary adjustments as the project progresses. And having dates and counts for each post on this blog will help me track my progress.
2. I divide the objectives and milestones into smaller, more manageable tasks and assign realistic timelines to each.
3. This captures my current topics of interest, and of course, is a living roadmap; my future posts may not look exactly like this calendar.
 
As a data science manager, I frequently plan to establish clear goals and objectives, allocate appropriate resources, and ultimately drive outcomes through successful projects. This ability is also being used in my writing. I'm hoping that this practice will help me develop a writing habit.
